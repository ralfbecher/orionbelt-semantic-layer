# Multi-Fact: Sales & Returns

This example demonstrates the **Composite Fact Layer (CFL)** planner with a multi-fact scenario. When a query combines measures from different fact tables, OrionBelt uses a CTE with `UNION ALL` to stitch the fact sets together (with NULL padding), then aggregates in the outer query.

## Scenario

An e-commerce company tracks **store sales** and **store returns** as separate fact tables, both sharing conformed dimensions: `Customers` and `Date Dim`.

```mermaid
graph LR
  SS["<b>Store Sales</b><br/><i>fact</i><br/>Sale ID<br/>Customer ID<br/>Date Key<br/>Amount"]
  SR["<b>Store Returns</b><br/><i>fact</i><br/>Return ID<br/>Customer ID<br/>Date Key<br/>Refund Amt"]
  C["<b>Customers</b><br/>Customer ID<br/>Name<br/>Country"]
  D["<b>Date Dim</b><br/>Date Key<br/>Full Date<br/>Year<br/>Quarter"]

  SS -->|many-to-one| C
  SS -->|many-to-one| D
  SR -->|many-to-one| C
  SR -->|many-to-one| D
```

Both fact tables join to the same dimension tables — these are **conformed dimensions**.

## Query 1: Single-Fact (Star Schema)

When a query only uses measures from one fact table, OrionBelt uses the standard **star schema** planner — no CTEs needed.

```python
query = QueryObject(
    select=QuerySelect(
        dimensions=["Customer Country"],
        measures=["Total Revenue"],
    ),
    order_by=[QueryOrderBy(field="Total Revenue", direction=SortDirection.DESC)],
    limit=100,
)
```

**Generated SQL (Postgres):**

```sql
SELECT
  "Customers"."COUNTRY" AS "Customer Country",
  SUM("Store Sales"."AMOUNT") AS "Total Revenue"
FROM WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.STORE_SALES AS "Store Sales"
LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS "Customers"
  ON "Store Sales"."CUSTOMER_ID" = "Customers"."CUSTOMER_ID"
GROUP BY "Customers"."COUNTRY"
ORDER BY "Total Revenue" DESC
LIMIT 100
```

This is a straightforward star schema query: one fact table (`Store Sales`) joined to one dimension table (`Customers`).

## Query 2: Multi-Fact (CFL with UNION ALL)

When measures come from **different** fact tables, OrionBelt detects this and switches to the CFL planner. It stitches the facts together with `UNION ALL` inside a CTE, then aggregates in the outer query.

```python
query = QueryObject(
    select=QuerySelect(
        dimensions=["Customer Country"],
        measures=["Total Revenue", "Total Returns"],
    ),
    order_by=[QueryOrderBy(field="Total Revenue", direction=SortDirection.DESC)],
    limit=100,
)
```

**Generated SQL (Postgres):**

```sql
WITH composite_01 AS (
  SELECT
    "Customers"."COUNTRY" AS "Customer Country",
    "Store Sales"."AMOUNT" AS "Total Revenue",
    NULL AS "Total Returns"
  FROM WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.STORE_SALES AS "Store Sales"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS "Customers"
    ON "Store Sales"."CUSTOMER_ID" = "Customers"."CUSTOMER_ID"

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
    "Customers"."COUNTRY" AS "Customer Country",
    NULL AS "Total Revenue",
    "Store Returns"."REFUND_AMT" AS "Total Returns"
  FROM WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.STORE_RETURNS AS "Store Returns"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS "Customers"
    ON "Store Returns"."CUSTOMER_ID" = "Customers"."CUSTOMER_ID"
)
SELECT
  "Customer Country",
  SUM("Total Revenue") AS "Total Revenue",
  SUM("Total Returns") AS "Total Returns"
FROM composite_01
GROUP BY "Customer Country"
ORDER BY "Total Revenue" DESC
LIMIT 100
```

### What Happened

1. **Measure grouping** — The resolver detected that `Total Revenue` comes from `Store Sales` and `Total Returns` comes from `Store Returns` — two different fact tables
2. **UNION ALL with NULL padding** — Each fact leg selects the conformed dimensions plus its own measure columns, filling the other fact's measures with `NULL`. This produces a single row set at the raw grain
3. **Outer aggregation** — The outer query groups by the conformed dimensions and applies `SUM` over the unioned rows. Because each row only has a value for one fact's measures (NULLs are ignored by `SUM`), the results are correct
4. **No fanout** — The facts are never joined directly to each other, so no many-to-many explosion occurs

!!! info "Snowflake: UNION BY NAME"
    On Snowflake, OrionBelt uses `UNION BY NAME` instead of `UNION ALL`. This matches columns by name rather than position, so the NULL padding columns can be omitted — each fact leg only selects its own measures.

## Why CFL is Necessary

Without the Composite Fact Layer, combining measures from different fact tables in a single query would cause **fanout** — a many-to-many join that inflates aggregation results:

```mermaid
graph LR
  SS["Store Sales<br/>10 rows"] --- C["Customers"]
  SR["Store Returns<br/>5 rows"] --- C

  style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333
```

> Direct join: 10 x 5 = 50 rows — wrong SUM results!

By stacking the facts with `UNION ALL` and aggregating outside, CFL eliminates fanout entirely. Each row in the union contributes to exactly one fact's measures.

!!! tip "When CFL Activates"
    The compiler automatically selects CFL when `requires_cfl = True` in the resolved query. This happens when the query's measures reference fields from multiple distinct fact tables. You do not need to opt in — OrionBelt detects it for you.

## Query 3: Net Revenue Metric

Metrics that combine measures from different fact tables also use CFL:

```python
query = QueryObject(
    select=QuerySelect(
        dimensions=["Customer Country", "Year"],
        measures=["Net Revenue"],
    ),
)
```

**Generated SQL (Postgres):**

```sql
WITH composite_01 AS (
  SELECT
    "Customers"."COUNTRY" AS "Customer Country",
    "Date Dim"."YEAR_NUM" AS "Year",
    "Store Sales"."AMOUNT" AS "Total Revenue",
    NULL AS "Total Returns"
  FROM WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.STORE_SALES AS "Store Sales"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS "Customers"
    ON "Store Sales"."CUSTOMER_ID" = "Customers"."CUSTOMER_ID"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.DATE_DIM AS "Date Dim"
    ON "Store Sales"."DATE_KEY" = "Date Dim"."DATE_KEY"

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
    "Customers"."COUNTRY" AS "Customer Country",
    "Date Dim"."YEAR_NUM" AS "Year",
    NULL AS "Total Revenue",
    "Store Returns"."REFUND_AMT" AS "Total Returns"
  FROM WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.STORE_RETURNS AS "Store Returns"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS AS "Customers"
    ON "Store Returns"."CUSTOMER_ID" = "Customers"."CUSTOMER_ID"
  LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE.PUBLIC.DATE_DIM AS "Date Dim"
    ON "Store Returns"."DATE_KEY" = "Date Dim"."DATE_KEY"
)
SELECT
  "Customer Country",
  "Year",
  (SUM("Total Revenue") - SUM("Total Returns")) AS "Net Revenue"
FROM composite_01
GROUP BY "Customer Country", "Year"
```

The metric expression `{[Total Revenue]} - {[Total Returns]}` is applied to the aggregated sums in the outer SELECT. Both measures are aggregated from the same `UNION ALL` result set, with NULLs naturally ignored by `SUM`.

!!! note "Multiple Conformed Dimensions"
    When there are multiple conformed dimensions (here: `Customer Country` and `Year`), both appear in the `GROUP BY` of the outer query. Each UNION leg joins its own dimension tables independently, so the grain is preserved correctly.
